# WebdriverIO TypeScript Appium Reference Project

Using TypeScript in conjunction with WebdriverIO, we can develop automation tests for our Android and iOS apps that replicate the same user interactions a human would perform â€” all from one language. As we incrementally develop new features in our apps, we can execute and maintain these tests solely in TypeScript, without context switching between Kotlin and Swift. But most importantly, through having automation tests we gain assurance that our code changes haven't negatively altered the user experience in our apps. 

This project will target the native Android Contacts app and can be used as a reference to setup a WebdriverIO project in TypeScript. 

## Run the test
```
npm run android-tests
```
